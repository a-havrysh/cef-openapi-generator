/**
 * Exception thrown when a service method has been declared but not yet implemented.
 *
 * <p>This exception is typically thrown by generated service stub methods that require
 * manual implementation. It serves as a clear indicator that:
 * <ul>
 *   <li>The API endpoint exists in the specification</li>
 *   <li>The method signature has been generated</li>
 *   <li>The business logic has not been implemented yet</li>
 * </ul>
 *
 * <p>When this exception is thrown, it usually means that developers need to provide
 * the actual implementation for the method. This is common in code generation scenarios
 * where the OpenAPI specification defines the API contract, but the implementation
 * details are left to the developer.
 *
 * <p>Note: This exception extends {@link RuntimeException} directly rather than
 * {@link ApiException}, as it represents a programming error rather than a runtime
 * HTTP error condition.
 *
 * <p>Auto-generated from OpenAPI specification.
