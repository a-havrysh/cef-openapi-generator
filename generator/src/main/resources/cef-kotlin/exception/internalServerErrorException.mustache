/**
 * Exception indicating an unexpected server-side error (HTTP 500 Internal Server Error).
 *
 * This exception should be thrown when the server encounters an unexpected condition
 * that prevents it from fulfilling a request. Common scenarios include:
 * - Uncaught exceptions during request processing
 * - Database connection failures
 * - Third-party service failures
 * - Logic errors in request handlers
 *
 * The client may retry the request, as the error is temporary (though often it is persistent).
 *
 * Auto-generated from OpenAPI specification.
